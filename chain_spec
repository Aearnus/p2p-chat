Here is the specification of the chain files.

The first line of each file contains the sha3-512 hash of that file, excluding the hash line. This is to check for validity when looking for peers.

The second line of each file is the version number of the file. Clients will not accept version numbers that are multiple versions in the future.

Each version number is a separate file, a separate "entry".

File 1: The User Index
===
These are the `users.<version number>` file. It contains a single entry:

    <sha3-512 hash>
    <version number>
    <nickname>
    <local ip>
    <port>
    <public key>

File 2: The Message Chain
===
These are the `messages.<version number>` file. It contains a single entry:

    <sha3-512 hash>
    <version number>
    <public key recipient>\t<public key recipient>\t...
    <encrypted message (output from gpg), beginning with ---BEGIN PGP MESSAGE--- and continuing through the end of the file>
